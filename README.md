dudelpad
========

Realtime multi-touch and multi-user sketchpad using node.js and socket.io (proof-of-concept)

howTo: 
	1) start drawserver.js by typing 'node drawserver.js'
	2) connect through a browser to the streaming page index.php
	3) let other users (and yourself too) connect to draw.php with a touchscreen device and start drawing!
 	4) shake your touch device to blank the board!
